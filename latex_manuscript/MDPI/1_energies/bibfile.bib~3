@article{Abdelkhalik2016,
	abstract = "This paper presents a shape-based approach to compute, in an optimal sense, the control of a single degree-of-freedom point absorber wave energy converter. In this study, it is assumed that a prediction for the wave is available. The control is computed so as to maximize the energy extraction over a future time horizon. In the shape-base approach, one of the system states is represented by a series expansion. The optimization variables are selected to be the coefficients in the series expansion instead of the history of the control variable. A gradient-based optimizer is used to optimize the series coefficients. The available wave prediction is used to compute an initial guess for the unknown series coefficients. This concept is tested on two different dynamic models: a simplified reduced-order model and a dynamic model with radiation dynamic states necessary to compute the radiation force. Several test cases are presented that cover a range of different sea states. The results show that the shape-based approach finds efficient solutions in terms of the extracted energy. The results also show that the obtained solutions are suitable for real-time implementation in terms of the smoothness of the obtained control and the speed of computations. Comparisons between the results of the shape-based approach and other techniques are presented and discussed.",

	abstract = "Satellite telemetry studies of the movements of seabirds are now common and have revealed impressive flight capabilities and extensive distributions among individuals and species at sea. Linking seabird movements with environmental conditions over vast expanses of the world's open ocean, however, remains difficult. Seabirds of the order Procellariiformes (e.g., petrels, albatrosses, and shearwaters) depend largely on wind and wave energy for efficient flight. We present a new method for quantifying the movements of far-ranging seabirds in relation to ocean winds measured by the SeaWinds scatterometer onboard the QuikSCAT satellite. We apply vector correlation (as defined by Crosby et al. in J Atm Ocean Tech 10:355--367, 1993) to evaluate how the trajectories (ground speed and direction) for five procellariiform seabirds outfitted with satellite transmitters are related to ocean winds. Individual seabirds (Sooty Shearwater, Pink-footed Shearwater, Hawaiian Petrel, Grey-faced Petrel, and Black-footed Albatross) all traveled predominantly with oblique, isotropic crossing to quartering tail-winds (i.e., 105--165{\textdegree} in relation to birds' trajectory). For all five seabirds, entire track line trajectories were significantly correlated with co-located winds. Greatest correlations along 8-day path segments were related to wind patterns during birds' directed, long-range migration (Sooty Shearwater) as well as movements associated with mega-scale meteorological phenomena, including Pacific Basin anticyclones (Hawaiian Petrel, Grey-faced Petrel) and eastward-propagating north Pacific cyclones (Black-footed Albatross). Wind strength and direction are important factors related to the overall movements that delineate the distribution of petrels at sea. We suggest that vector correlation can be used to quantify movements for any marine vertebrate when tracking and environmental data (winds or currents) are of sufficient quality and sample size. Vector correlation coefficients can then be used to assess population---or species-specific variability and used to test specific hypotheses related to how animal movements are associated with fluid environments.",

	abstract = "Abstract In this paper we tackle the problem of massive missing data reconstruction in ocean buoys, with an evolutionary product unit neural network (EPUNN). When considering a large number of buoys to reconstruct missing data, it is sometimes difficult to find a common period of completeness (without missing data on it) in the data to form a proper training and test set. In this paper we solve this issue by using partial reconstruction, which are then used as inputs of the EPUNN, with linear models. Missing data reconstruction in several phases or steps is then proposed. In this work we also show the potential of \{EPUNN\} to obtain simple, interpretable models in spite of the non-linear characteristic of the neural network, much simpler than the commonly used sigmoid-based neural systems. In the experimental section of the paper we show the performance of the proposed approach in a real case of massive missing data reconstruction in 6 wave-rider buoys at the Gulf of Alaska.",

Often, different sources provide deviating and even contradicting data for the same geographical area and time. This implies that users need to evaluate the relative reliability of the information and then trust one of the sources. We present a novel data fusion method that merges the data from different sources for a given area and time, ensuring the best data quality. The method is a unique combination of land-use regression techniques, statistical air quality modelling and a well-known data fusion algorithm. We show experiments where a fused temperature forecast outperforms individual temperature forecasts from several providers. Also, we demonstrate that the local hourly NO2 concentration can be estimated accurately with our fusion method while a more conventional extrapolation method falls short. The method forms part of the prototype web-based service PESCaDO, designed to cater personalized environmental information to users.",

	abstract = "In this paper we present a stylized economy-energy-climate model and discuss the role of the atmosphere, fossil fuels, and a stock of accumulated knowledge about renewable energy technologies in collaboratively and competitively managed worlds. The model highlights that assumptions about the {\lq}degree of competition{\rq} and about choices of lumping economic regions, and hence their heterogeneity, strongly affect model predictions about the rate of fossil fuel use and, consequently, the rate of climate change. In the model, decisionmakers (actors) make decisions about investment allocations into the goods producing economy and into carbon-based and non-carbon-based (renewable) energy supply, the remainder being for consumption. Actors are faced with the following dilemma situation. Economic growth requires energy and will therefore accelerate fossil fuel depletion and generate growth in carbon emissions, the latter leading to global warming and climate change induced damages. By developing non-carbon energy sources, which come initially at a higher cost than fossil fuels, growth of carbon emissions can be curtailed. Trying to optimize a consumption-related utility, actors base their decisions on the economically most rational investment portfolio for a finite time horizon. However, in their decisionmaking, they are constrained by the choices of other actors. We consider two prototypical situations: (i) a collaborative environment where all actors strive to maximize a world utility -- the global optimum -- and (ii) a situation where actors optimize the utility of their own country -- a solution that corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. The difference between both outcomes can be used to classify the severity of the {\lq}tragedy of the commons effect{\rq}. We present results about the dependence of the severity of this effect on several key parameters (i) the number of actors, (ii) the heterogeneity and severity of expected climate damages, (iii) assumptions about technology diffusion and (iv) fossil fuel depletion.",

Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) have at least three attributes that make them an excellent choice to communicate physics-based wave model predictions. First, BBNs subsume thousands of predictions to provide probabilistic outcomes. Second, by using prior probabilities, a practitioner can still obtain predictions of wave outcomes even when their knowledge of input parameters is incomplete. Third, BBNs can propagate evidence from outputs to inputs, which can be used to identify input conditions that are most likely to deliver a chosen outcome. These three attributes are tested and found to hold for a BBN developed for this purpose.",

Whereas the former two can be considered \&lsquo;rentier states\&rsquo; heavily depending on oil (and gas) revenues, the latter only leans on oil for a mere 6\% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Although the economic rise has brought considerable welfare, it has also led these emirates to attain the world\&rsquo;s highest per capita carbon footprint. To address this problem Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai seem to have formulated policies with regard to sustainable urbanisation and adopted strong branding strategies to promote them internally and externally. In this paper we examine which steps have been taken to substantiate their claims to sustainable urbanisation, in branding as well as in actions taken towards implementation. We find that all three have been very active in branding their sustainable urbanisation policies, through visions and policy frameworks as well as prestigious development projects, but that the former is substantially more impressive than the latter. Results also show there is a difference between Abu Dhabi and Qatar on the one hand, and Dubai on the other. Dubai has large number of small \&lsquo;free economic zones\&rsquo;, academic institutions for developing a knowledge economy, and smart and/or sustainable urban neighbourhoods, while Qatar and Abu Dhabi have a small number of very large ones. From the three, it is currently Dubai which has taken the lead in this development, largely completing its industrial transition with vast economic diversification and urban expansion. However, across the board this has had little effect on its ecological footprint.",

A wave prediction system based on the Simulating Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) has been implemented and intensively tested in the entire sea basin. Moreover, considering an optimal interpolation technique, an assimilation scheme of the satellite data has been developed, leading to a visible improvement of the wave model predictions in terms of significant wave heights and, consequently, also in terms of wave power. Using this wave prediction system with data assimilation, simulations have been performed for a 15-year period (1999--2013). Considering the results of this 15-year wave hindcast, an analysis of the wave energy conditions in the basin of the Black Sea has been carried out. This provided a more comprehensive picture concerning the wave energy patterns in the coastal environment of the Black Sea focused on the average wave conditions that might be expected in this sea. Following the results presented, it can be concluded that the wave energy extraction in the Black Sea can become an issue of interest, especially from the perspective of the hybrid solutions.",
