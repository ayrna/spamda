This work develops a framework to collect, integrate, and preprocess meteorological observation data from NDBC and NNRP.
Moreover, this framework uses machine learning techniques to do predictions based on these pre-processed datasets. This work
saves researchers from tedious and repetitive data collection and pre-processing work. Also, the use of machine learning in this framework is very useful given that NDBC and NNRP contain missing data in their observation datasets.

\vspace{0.5cm}
My only comment is that the wave prediction from the machine learning technique is not well validated.
}


\textbf{Response:}
{
Thank you very much for your review and your comment which we try to clarify below.

This work does not focus on carrying out an extensive experimentation and validation of results obtained by different ML and SC techniques, together with statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different prediction methodologies. This work presents a very versatile software tool that facilitates the automated building of meteorological datasets from which researchers can carry out prediction studies and apply them to tasks related to coastal and ocean engineering and marine energy prediction.

Nevertheless, although it is not the main objective, this software tool also allows the use of ML and SC methods available in WEKA from SPAMDA itself or from an independent WEKA instance. In this way, researchers can carry out a preliminary study or even a complete study on the prediction problem which they are working on. However, SPAMDA also gives the possibility to save the integrated datasets in .csv format, so that researchers can use these datasets with other ML and SC tools that they consider appropriate.

%TODO: Insertar revisión sobre la ampliación del caso de estudio.

\textcolor{red}{TODO: Cambiar este párrafo por el definitivo sobre la ampliación del caso de estudio. We have also extended the case study of this paper with an additional experiment regarding the short-term prediction of the energy flux generated by the waves in a location in the Gulf of Alaska. This prediction is configurable respect to the prediction horizon, which could provide a prediction of how much energy could be obtained through WECs, for example, within the next 6 hours. The Reviewer \# 1 can view this extension in the \textbf{red lines and new figures in Section ``4. A case study applied to Gulf of Alaska''. Some lines (red lines) in Sections ``3.4. Matching configuration'' and ``3.5. Final datasets'' also had to be rewritten for this purpose, as well as unifying several figures.}}

Dear authors,
Thank you for submitting your paper to the Energies. I think your paper is an informative paper that can be published after a major revision.

\vspace{0.5cm}
It is not clear what the research gap that the paper is addressing. What is the objective of this paper? Please clarify somewhere clearly all your contributions.
}

\textbf{Response:}
{
First of all, we would like to thank Reviewer \#2 for his/her suggestions to improve the paper.

The reviewer is right about this comment, we have not adequately indicated what the purpose of this work is. We think that this work can be useful as a support for applications in fields of marine energy and engineering and environment, by creating datasets well-formed and ready to be used with ML and SC prediction techniques. Datasets can be used both in classification and regression problems from the integration of NDBC observations and NNRP reanalysis data.

In our understanding, manuscripts in marine energy and engineering that use ML and SC algorithms for prediction tasks, do not provide tools for incorporating and integrating the two data sources used by SPAMDA and considering the casuistry involved. These studies apply specific algorithms (extreme learning machine, metaheuristics, Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, etc) on data, using own implementations or scripts developed in some programming language, but they do not allow to build  datasets ready to be used with any of those methodologies or algorithms by an automated and very versatile process. In this sense, it is convenient to indicate that, therefore, the objectives of these types of works and our contributions are different. Although this software allows the use of ML and SC algorithms available in WEKA (datasets can be also created in .csv format to researchers can use other tools appart from WEKA), we do not focus on those methodologies nor on improving them.

Some of these clarifications are expressed in \textbf{Section ``1. Introduction" (lines 112-129)}, and others have been added in \textbf{''Abstract`` (lines 10-19)} and \textbf{Section ``5. Conclusions`` (lines 759-769)}, so that the reader can better understand the scope of our work. \textbf{Comments 4 and 9} suggested by Reviewer \#2 are also related to these clarifications included in \textbf{''Abstract``} and \textbf{Section ''5. Conclusions''}.

%\textcolor{blue}{So that the reader can better understand the scope of this work, it is necessary to indicate that this work does not focus on carrying out extensive experimentation and validation of results, together with statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different prediction methodologies. We do not focus on the ML and SC methodologies and the comparisons used by the researcher, we provide an automated and versatile process that builds a data integration of NDBC and NNRP well-formatted and with the possibility of multiple configurations. It, along with another series of functionalities related to this integration and that are explained in depth throughout the manuscript.}

At the end of \textbf{Section ``1. Introduction'', (lines 133-171)}, we have tried to summarize in a general way the contributions of SPAMDA, which are specified and detailed throughout the paper. Below, we comment on some contributions that have also been taken into account in this revised version of the manuscript (\textbf{highlighted in blue color}):
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item SPAMDA allows preliminary studies of missing values (dates or measurements not recorded) in buoys managed by NDBC, so that researchers have an idea of the quality of data observed by buoys and whether these would be suitable for the work to be carried out. Sometimes, buoys do not collect observations temporarily due to mechanical problems or weather conditions, so depending on the problem to be solved, such raw data could not be appropriate for accurate modelling. Even so, SPAMDA allows data integration taking into account such missing values when needed by researchers. More details about how this task is performed can be found in \textbf{Section ``2. Meteorological data sources'', lines 212-219 (``Note ...Appendix A.''), Section ``3.2. Datasets'', lines 287-290 (``When ...dates.''), Section ``3.3. Pre-process'', lines 319-332 (``Recover ...values mean.''), Section ``3.4. Matching configuration'', lines 402-407 (``Include ...as \guillemotleft\textit{?}\guillemotright''), and Section ``Appendix A. Managing the casuistry of incomplete data''}.

	\item Although pre-processing is not the main objective of SPAMDA, the tool also provides some basic pre-processing filters on buoys measurements, such as normalisation and missing data recovery (more details about it in \textbf{Section ``3.3. Pre-process'', lines 327-332 (``Replace ...values mean'')}).
	
	\item Building of different configurations of datasets with little effort and in an automated process, either regarding the input variables from the NNRP (in the original .nc format are unreadable) or the output variable to be used in prediction tasks using NDBC data, both for classification and for regression (more details about it in \textbf{Section ``3.4. Matching configuration'' and Section ''3.5. Final datasets``}).
	
	\item The possibility of using, also in an automated process, several reanalysis nodes near to the NDBC buoy under study, so that a greater amount of information is available, which could provide more accurate models (more details about it in \textbf{Section ''3.4. Matching configuration``, lines 408-421 (''Nearest ...respectively``)}).
	
	\item Estimation of the amount of energy flux that can be produced at different prediction horizons, for example, what approximate amount of energy could bet obtained in 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, ... It should be taken into account that with a greater prediction horizon the models tend to generalise worse, but that is something we do not focus on either, it is a decision of the researcher (more details in \textbf{Section ''3.5. Final datasets``, lines 467-506 (''Prediction ...(${t+\Delta t}$ in Eq. 5)``)}.	

	\item This software would be provided to the scientific community as a free and open source tool, so that any researcher could access its source code and extend its functionality (the github repository is show in \textbf{Section "Additional material"}).
\end{itemize}

From an applicability point of view, SPAMDA could be used in ocean engineering applications, and applications related to marine energy and prediction, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimate the need for other energy sources in hybrid energy systems, based on the amount of energy that can be obtained by a marine energy system in the next 6 hours or 12 hours for example.
    
    \item Regulation of WECs to avoid malfunction or breakage, depending on the significant wave height and/or energy flux expected, as well as the possibility of reconfiguring them in order to maximise the wave energy extraction.
        
    \item Decision-making in exploitation and environmental protection for the construction of marine energy storage plants, future strategies on renewable energy and coastal planning.
    
    \item Support for the prediction of the energy that could be obtained from a certain maritime location, so that it is possible to know whether or not it is convenient to install WECS in marine structures such as offshore oil and gas platforms or seawater desalination plants.
        
    \item Design of offshore structures and ports.
    
    \item Decision-making and risk assessment about operational works in the sea, security systems for structures or naval security.
\end{itemize}

Some of these clarifications about applicability have been written in \textbf{Section ''1. Introduction``, lines 172-186.}

The literature review is not goal-oriented. The process should be as follows:

\vspace{0.5cm}
i) Critical evaluation of the literature; ii) identifying the gap based on this critical evaluation of the literature; iii) proposing your hypothesis to address the identified gap; iv) posing the appropriate and relevant research question based on your proposed hypothesis, and finally explaining your proposed method to answer this research question. Therefore, you will have a systematic way of conducting your research. Right now, the literature review section has no clear objective.

\textbf{Response:}
{
Thank you very much to the reviewer for questioning this fact and allow us to clarify it.

Although we have cited some software tools related to energy prediction and environmental modelling, as well as works that use ML and SC methodologies in marine energy studies (now much more complete with the references provided by the Reviewer \#2 in \textbf{Comment 7}), we have not carried out an exhaustive review of the state-of-the-art because, to our knowledge, there are no open source software tools available to the scientific community, that perform the data integration provided by SPAMDA with the functionalities described in this work. 

The reading order of the contents shown in \textbf{Section "1. Introduction"}, has been carried out with the intention that is commented below, and the background has been reinforced with the interesting references suggested by the Reviewer \#2 (\textbf{Section ''1. Introduction, lines 37-39, 66, 74, 80-81, 86-94}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, the reader is introduced to the importance of having quality and well-formed meteorological data and observations concerning studies of environmental comprehension, conservation, modelling and prediction, providing examples of this. It is also indicated that ML and SC methodologies, despite managing uncertainty, need adequate data for the creation of good models. \textbf{Lines 23-43 (``A better ...models.'')}.
       
    \item Continuing in that line, in second place it is indicated that researchers need special-purpose software to be able to perform data adaptation tasks and to carry out studies related to energy and environmental modelling. \textbf{Lines 44-59 (``Continuing ...traker'')}.
    
    \item Thirdly, marine energy is introduced as one of the most widely used renewable and sustainable energy sources today, where meteorological data is used for prediction purposes. Wecs are also introduced as the main mechanical devices for capturing and converting energy from waves and tides. It is concluded that both for the correct design and use of WECS and for other applications related to marine energy, it is very useful to have adequate prediction models, for which it is necessary to have both data and techniques that use them. \textbf{Lines 60-77 (``Marine ...\textit{wave energy period} ($T_e$).'')}.
    
    \item Fourthly, it is commented how current ML and SC methodologies are supporting traditional statistical modelling procedures and that there are tools such as Weka that can be used even by researchers who are not specialized in the field of artificial intelligence or in the use of programming languages.  Also included are examples of work using ML algorithms for wave height and energy flow prediction in relation to marine energy. In this part, it is emphasized that both for these tools that offer a user-friendly environment for researchers not specialized in ML and for more specific work, the data is essential and is usually not in the right format. This causes them to have shortcomings and inconsistencies that prevent their treatment, so a great deal of effort and time is spent on resolving them. \textbf{Lines 78-111 (``Currently ...tedious task.'')}.  
    
    \item Next, it is indicated that the main purpose of this work is to solve in an automatic, versatile and simple way, the integration of observations from NDBC and reanalysis data from NNRP, without focusing on the ML and SC methodologies that use them. For it, a software tool has been developed that takes into account the casuistry involved in this data integration for marine energy prediction tasks. \textbf{Lines 112-129 (``The main ...tools'')}.
        
    \item Finally, the functionalities and the general contributions of the developed tool are indicated, as well as some examples of applicability. \textbf{Lines 130-171 (``In order to ...system''), 172-186 (``Therefore, ...planning'')} .The following sections of the manuscript explain in detail the contributions of SPAMDA and how they are carried out, ending with a case study in the Gulf of Alaska about significant wave height and energy flux prediction.

Thanks you very much to the reviewer for her/his suggestion. As this work is not a study that presents a prediction methodology related to marine energy, and whose results must be compared with other methodologies in the state-of-the-art, there is no a Section ``Results''. 

Nevertheless, a case study applied to the Gulf of Alaska is carried out to predict significant wave height and energy flux from a data integration from NDBC and NNRP using SPAMDA. Therefore, \textbf{we have extended the case study} of the initial version of this paper with experimentation about energy flux prediction that reinforces the usefulness of this software, but without entering into comparisons on the performance of the different methodologies used. Only typical measures of comparison as CCR (Accuracy), Kappa or MSE (Root Mean Squared Error) are shown, since that is not the purpose of this work. 

This experimental extension is included in the \textbf{red lines and new figures in Section ``4. A case study applied to Gulf of Alaska''. Some lines (red lines) in Sections ``3.4. Matching configuration'' and ``3.5. Final datasets'' also had to be rewritten for this purpose, as well as unifying several figures. We have tried to add as few figures as possible to take into account Comment 6, which the Reviewer \#2 also suggests.}

To our knowledge, we can not make a comparison with other applications as there are no tools with the functionality shown in this work. There may be applications, console programs or scripts that use NDBC and NNRP data to perform some type of prediction or processing of that data, but we have not found in the literature any open source software available to the scientific community that performs data integration as described in this paper. We have also not found software that shows the functionalities and configurations available in SPAMDA about the final data integration, besides being able to manage buoys and reanalysis data in a versatile, simple way and with a format that can be easily used or adapted to any ML and SC algorithm you want to use.

\rcomment{
The Authors present a new open source tool for the creation of datasets integrated by meteorological variables from two sources
of information. Basically, a user-friendly software has been developed and described on the basis of pivotal parameters, carefully selected for the specific study of the wave height in the Gulf of Alaska. The statistical model can be in principle extended to other meteorological measurements and monitoring. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
This study is very technical and of interest for a specific audience. By the way, I don’t see any link between the topic of the manuscript and the journal Energies.

\vspace{0.5cm}
The software developed it is clearly presented as useful tool for meteorological application and no application to energy saving, production, conversion or similar it is presented.

\vspace{0.5cm}
Thus, I recommend to submit the menuscript to a more specialized journal.

\textbf{Response:}

First of all, we would like to thank Reviewer \#3 for his/her suggestions.

We had not adequately indicated what the purpose of this work is in the initial version, we hope that it is now better clarified. So that the reader can better understand the scope of this work, it is necessary to indicate that this work does not focus on carrying out extensive experimentation and validation of results, together with statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different prediction methodologies. We do not focus on the ML and SC methodologies and the comparisons used by the researcher, we provide an automated and versatile process that builds a data integration of NDBC and NNRP well-formatted and with the possibility of multiple configurations, along with another series of functionalities related to this integration and that are explained in depth throughout the manuscript.

In this revised version of the manuscript we have tried to clarify the contributions of this work, emphasizing it mainly in \textbf{Abstract, lines 10-19, Section “1. Introduction”, lines 133-171, 172-186 and Section “5. Conclusions“, lines 759-769.} Another place in the paper where the possibility of using this tool in relation to the WECS is discussed is found in \textbf{''Section “1. Introduction”, lines 60-77}. 

In our opinion, we think that this work can be useful and support applications in the field of energy and the environment, and in energy saving, production and conversion processes. Prediction works using ML and SC algorithms do not provide a simple tool to incorporate and integrate the two data sources used by SPAMDA and the casuistry that this entails. These studies apply specific algorithms (extreme learning machine, metaheuristics, Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, etc) on specific data, from own implementations or scripts made with some programming language, but they do not allow to build datasets ready to be used with any of those methodologies or algorithms by an automated and versatile process.

We think that this software tool can be used in coastal and ocean engineering applications, and applications related to marine energy and prediction, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimate the need for other energy sources in hybrid energy systems, based on the amount of energy that can be obtained by a marine energy system in the next 6 hours or 12 hours for example.
    
    \item Regulation of WECs to avoid malfunction or breakage, depending on the significant wave height and/or energy flux expected, as well as the possibility of reconfiguring them in order to maximise the wave energy extraction.
        
    \item Decision-making in exploitation and environmental protection for the construction of marine energy storage plants, future strategies on renewable energy and coastal planning.
    
    \item Support for the prediction of the energy that could be obtained from a certain maritime location, so that it is possible to know whether or not it is convenient to install WECS in marine structures such as offshore oil and gas platforms or seawater desalination plants.
        
    \item Design of offshore structures and ports.
    
    \item Decision-making and risk assessment about operational works in the sea, security systems for structures or naval security.
\end{itemize}

Finally, to try to clarify more that this application can be used in the field of marine energy, \textbf{we have extended the case study} carried out in the Gulf of Alaska with a \textbf{short-term forecasting of energy flux} generated by the waves of the location used. In this way, it would be possible to predict 6 hours in advance (configurable prediction horizon), how much energy could be obtained with the use of WECs. The Reviewer \#3 can view this extension in the \textbf{red lines and new figures in Section ''4. A case study applied to Gulf of Alaska``. Some lines (red lines) in Sections ''3.4. Matching configuration`` and ''3.5. Final datasets`` also had to be rewritten for this purpose, as well as unifying several figures}.
