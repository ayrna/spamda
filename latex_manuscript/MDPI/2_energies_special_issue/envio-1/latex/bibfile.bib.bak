@article{Abdelkhalik2016,
	abstract = "This paper presents a shape-based approach to compute, in an optimal sense, the control of a single degree-of-freedom point absorber wave energy converter. In this study, it is assumed that a prediction for the wave is available. The control is computed so as to maximize the energy extraction over a future time horizon. In the shape-base approach, one of the system states is represented by a series expansion. The optimization variables are selected to be the coefficients in the series expansion instead of the history of the control variable. A gradient-based optimizer is used to optimize the series coefficients. The available wave prediction is used to compute an initial guess for the unknown series coefficients. This concept is tested on two different dynamic models: a simplified reduced-order model and a dynamic model with radiation dynamic states necessary to compute the radiation force. Several test cases are presented that cover a range of different sea states. The results show that the shape-based approach finds efficient solutions in terms of the extracted energy. The results also show that the obtained solutions are suitable for real-time implementation in terms of the smoothness of the obtained control and the speed of computations. Comparisons between the results of the shape-based approach and other techniques are presented and discussed.",

@article{Adams2010,
	abstract = "Satellite telemetry studies of the movements of seabirds are now common and have revealed impressive flight capabilities and extensive distributions among individuals and species at sea. Linking seabird movements with environmental conditions over vast expanses of the world's open ocean, however, remains difficult. Seabirds of the order Procellariiformes (e.g., petrels, albatrosses, and shearwaters) depend largely on wind and wave energy for efficient flight. We present a new method for quantifying the movements of far-ranging seabirds in relation to ocean winds measured by the SeaWinds scatterometer onboard the QuikSCAT satellite. We apply vector correlation (as defined by Crosby et al. in J Atm Ocean Tech 10:355--367, 1993) to evaluate how the trajectories (ground speed and direction) for five procellariiform seabirds outfitted with satellite transmitters are related to ocean winds. Individual seabirds (Sooty Shearwater, Pink-footed Shearwater, Hawaiian Petrel, Grey-faced Petrel, and Black-footed Albatross) all traveled predominantly with oblique, isotropic crossing to quartering tail-winds (i.e., 105--165{\textdegree} in relation to birds' trajectory). For all five seabirds, entire track line trajectories were significantly correlated with co-located winds. Greatest correlations along 8-day path segments were related to wind patterns during birds' directed, long-range migration (Sooty Shearwater) as well as movements associated with mega-scale meteorological phenomena, including Pacific Basin anticyclones (Hawaiian Petrel, Grey-faced Petrel) and eastward-propagating north Pacific cyclones (Black-footed Albatross). Wind strength and direction are important factors related to the overall movements that delineate the distribution of petrels at sea. We suggest that vector correlation can be used to quantify movements for any marine vertebrate when tracking and environmental data (winds or currents) are of sufficient quality and sample size. Vector correlation coefficients can then be used to assess population---or species-specific variability and used to test specific hypotheses related to how animal movements are associated with fluid environments.",

When considering a large number of buoys to reconstruct missing data, it is sometimes difficult to find a common period of completeness (without missing data on it) in the data to form a proper training and test set. In this paper we solve this issue by using partial reconstruction, which are then used as inputs of the EPUNN, with linear models. Missing data reconstruction in several phases or steps is then proposed. In this work we also show the potential of \{EPUNN\} to obtain simple, interpretable models in spite of the non-linear characteristic of the neural network, much simpler than the commonly used sigmoid-based neural systems. In the experimental section of the paper we show the performance of the proposed approach in a real case of massive missing data reconstruction in 6 wave-rider buoys at the Gulf of Alaska.},

	abstract = "In this paper we present a stylized economy-energy-climate model and discuss the role of the atmosphere, fossil fuels, and a stock of accumulated knowledge about renewable energy technologies in collaboratively and competitively managed worlds. The model highlights that assumptions about the {\lq}degree of competition{\rq} and about choices of lumping economic regions, and hence their heterogeneity, strongly affect model predictions about the rate of fossil fuel use and, consequently, the rate of climate change. In the model, decisionmakers (actors) make decisions about investment allocations into the goods producing economy and into carbon-based and non-carbon-based (renewable) energy supply, the remainder being for consumption. Actors are faced with the following dilemma situation. Economic growth requires energy and will therefore accelerate fossil fuel depletion and generate growth in carbon emissions, the latter leading to global warming and climate change induced damages. By developing non-carbon energy sources, which come initially at a higher cost than fossil fuels, growth of carbon emissions can be curtailed. Trying to optimize a consumption-related utility, actors base their decisions on the economically most rational investment portfolio for a finite time horizon. However, in their decisionmaking, they are constrained by the choices of other actors. We consider two prototypical situations: (i) a collaborative environment where all actors strive to maximize a world utility -- the global optimum -- and (ii) a situation where actors optimize the utility of their own country -- a solution that corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. The difference between both outcomes can be used to classify the severity of the {\lq}tragedy of the commons effect{\rq}. We present results about the dependence of the severity of this effect on several key parameters (i) the number of actors, (ii) the heterogeneity and severity of expected climate damages, (iii) assumptions about technology diffusion and (iv) fossil fuel depletion.",

First, BBNs subsume thousands of predictions to provide probabilistic outcomes. Second, by using prior probabilities, a practitioner can still obtain predictions of wave outcomes even when their knowledge of input parameters is incomplete. Third, BBNs can propagate evidence from outputs to inputs, which can be used to identify input conditions that are most likely to deliver a chosen outcome.

In this context, the assessment of wave energy potential along with socioeconomic and environmental factors in a selected area at the north side of Gran Canaria Island shows that wave power availability is adequate for its exploitation and there are no sources of potential conflicts that prevent the installation of wave energy converters.

Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the use of AI techniques and mixed models to estimate the volume and biomass of individual trees in vegetation of Brazilian central savanna. Numerical variables (diameter at height of 1.30 m of ground, total height, volume and biomass) and categorical variables (species) were used for the training and fitting of AI techniques and mixed models, respectively. The statistical indicators used to evaluate the training and the adjustment were the correlation coefficient, bias and Root mean square error relative. In addition, graphs were elaborated as complementary analysis. The results obtained by the statistical indicators and the graphical analysis show the great potential of AI techniques and mixed models in the estimation of volume and biomass of individual trees in Brazilian savanna vegetation.

	abstract = "Offshore oil and gas platforms have very high-power demands, being the electric power supply usually provided by gas turbines operating with natural gas extracted from the field. Since fields are ageing, the amount of gas available for electric power production is declining. One common alternative is to feed those gas turbines with fuel diesel, which is an expensive solution at remote locations and has a high carbon footprint. Since oil and gas platforms often operate in deep waters and are exposed to energetic wave climates, ocean wave energy can be used in their electrification. Even though wave energy is not yet cost competitive for suppling onshore grids, power supplying remote oil and gas platforms might be the niche market enabler to launch commercially the sector, due to the high cost of the electricity produced in those offshore facilities and the abundance of wave resource at most of their locations. This paper proposes a new techno-economic model to assess and scale wave energy converters to match the local wave climate at their deployment site, while maximizing the income of the wave farm and accounting for their life cycle costs. At the same time, the economic feasibility of providing electricity from ocean waves to remote offshore oil and gas facilities is analysed using as case study an oil and gas platform in operation at the North Sea. Seven wave energy converters were assessed at the case study site and it was proved that its hydrodynamic performance is not directly linked to its economics attractiveness. The values of the levelized cost of energy ranged from 188 to 471 €/MWh and were benchmarked against reference values. The feasibility of providing electricity from waves to offshore oil and gas facilities is also demonstrated and the exploration of this untapped market advocated.",

	abstract = "Accurate solar photovoltaic power forecasting can help mitigate the potential risk caused by the uncertainty of photovoltaic out power in systems with high penetration levels of solar photovoltaic generation. Weather classification based photovoltaic power forecasting modeling is an effective method to enhance its forecasting precision because photovoltaic output power strongly depends on the specific weather statuses in a given time period. However, the most intractable problems in weather classification models are the insufficiency of training dataset (especially for the extreme weather types) and the selection of applied classifiers. Given the above considerations, a generative adversarial networks and convolutional neural networks-based weather classification model is proposed in this paper. First, 33 meteorological weather types are reclassified into 10 weather types by putting several single weather types together to constitute a new weather type. Then a data-driven generative model named generative adversarial networks is employed to augment the training dataset for each weather types. Finally, the convolutional neural networks-based weather classification model was trained by the augmented dataset that consists of both original and generated solar irradiance data. In the case study, we evaluated the quality of generative adversarial networks-generated data, compared the performance of convolutional neural networks classification models with traditional machine learning classification models such as support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors algorithm, investigated the precision improvement of different classification models achieved by generative adversarial networks, and applied the weather classification models in solar irradiance forecasting. The simulation results illustrate that generative adversarial networks can generate new samples with high quality that capture the intrinsic features of the original data, but not to simply memorize the training data. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks classification models show better classification performance than traditional machine learning models. And the performance of all these classification models is indeed improved to the different extent via the generative adversarial networks-based data augment. In addition, weather classification model plays a significant role in determining the most suitable and precise day-ahead photovoltaic power forecasting model with high efficiency.",

The high spatial variability of atmospheric variables within the grid resolution (pixel) leads to important errors in those areas with great atmospheric variability, such as in mountainous regions. In this paper, the performance of three clear-sky solar irradiance models was evaluated in a site with especially great elevation range, the Izana station from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (Tenerife, Canary Islands) located at a high elevation (2373m) and just 14km from the ocean. Aerosols data were obtained from measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) at the same site. The evaluation was also compared with global horizontal irradiance estimations with clear-sky models in the Guimar station, located at a lower elevation (156m) and only 11.5km away from Izana.

	abstract = "The global development of the offshore renewable energy sector has been driven by extensive investment and research in the utilization of offshore renewable energies, mainly at the regional level. However, for mid to long-term marine energy development planning, a comprehensive assessment of the global potential for the exploitation of the main offshore resources is required. This work developed and implemented an innovative methodological approach to identify potential zones for wind and wave energy exploitation at the global level, using long-term data series with fine spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed methodology was based on a five-step approach comprised of: (i) a resource assessment, to identify the zones with favorable conditions for energy exploitation; (ii) a structural survivability assessment, to identify feasible areas which would likely ensure the integrity and durability of the wind and wave devices; (iii) a logistics assessment, to evaluate the possibility of carrying out installation, operations, and maintenance activities; (iv) an assessment of the distance to consumer centers, to estimate the feasibility of transmission to the main urban areas; and (v) an estimate of the extractable power of the identified potential zones. For wind power, the United Kingdom (with 1470 TWh/month using a 10-MW turbine) and the United States (1079 TWh/month) were the countries with the highest estimated energy output of the identified potential zones. For wave energy, Brazil and New Zealand presented good opportunities for the development of the wave energy industry, with an estimated extractable power of 372 TWh/month and 286 TWh/month, respectively. The unique preliminary global analysis presented in this work provides guidelines to assist in the development of wave and offshore wind industries, in addition to supporting the management of marine spaces. Moreover, the methodologies can be replicated for other marine activities.",

For the purpose of investigating the adequate training length of ANN simulations, four training periods (Year 2002--2005, 2003--2005, 2004--2005 and 2005) together with four training intervals (yearly, half-yearly, seasonal, and monthly) are input into the ANN model to estimate monthly capacity factors of the two stations at Year 2006 and compared with the measured data. The results show that ANN is an efficient tool for estimating wind power production. A training length with 12months can provide satisfactory estimation of monthly capacity factors in both of the stations. Moreover, the half-yearly training interval, which is derived from the real wind characteristics in Taiwan, gives the best estimation of monthly capacity factors compared to other training intervals.",

In this approach, one-to-one correspondence between each special-shaped machining feature and each cutting tool is first analyzed and established.

To this end, each special-shaped machining feature is represented by its multiple drawing views that contain rich information for differentiating each of these features. With numbers of these views as training set, a deep residual network (ResNet) is trained successfully for feature recognition, where the recognized feature's cutting tool could also be automatically selected based on the one-to-one correspondence. With the learned ResNet, engineers could use an engineering drawing to select cutting tools intelligently.

In this study, a new problem formulation for the optimum layout design of onshore wind farms is presented, where the wind load is implemented using stochastic fields. For this purpose, a metaheuristic search algorithm based on a discrete variant of the harmony search method is used for solving the problem at hand. The farm layout problem is by nature a constrained optimization problem, and the contribution of the wake effects is significant; therefore, in two formulations presented in this study the influence of wind direction is also taken into account and compared with the scenario that the wake effect is ignored.

A realistic approach to the exploitation conditions and potential that could occur in a SGE plant in these ecosystems is presented. We first analyzed the variability of salinity and temperature in the three characteristic zones of the coastal lagoon and the correlation of these variables with atmospheric forcing. This was done using 1 year records of in situ measurements. Then the theoretical potential for SGE and the intra-annual variability of that potential were assessed considering the three possible harvesting configurations of mixing among fresh, sea, and hypersaline water. Results show that the thermohaline structure may vary significantly for the three locations at different time scales (diurnal to seasonal) depending on the tides, winds, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. That suggests that the highest annual energy yield would be obtained from alternating throughout the year among the mixing configurations, depending on the specific seasonal thermohaline structure of the lagoon.",

In the experimental part of study, nine collector prototypes with different geometries were tested at different conditions to investigate the effect of the collector depth and length on the collector thermal performance and also, to provide the required data for the network evaluation. The collector depth and length, the working fluid flowrate and concentration and the reduced temperature difference are selected as input parameters of the network to estimate the collector efficiency and Nusselt number. The proposed artificial neural network approach proved that the variation of the collector depth of 5--15 mm increases the collector efficiency about 9\%, while the collector length has an insignificant effect on the collector efficiency. The Nusselt number of the collector increases considerably by the collector depth and nanofluid flowrate. The proposed network has the best performance for predicting the collector efficiency with nanofluid concentration of 1000 ppm as the input parameter by achieving the MAPE of 1.470\%. In the case of predicting Nusselt number, the best performance with MAPE of 2.576\% is obtained with collector length of 300 mm.

In the final phase, household activities that consume hot water, such as washing dishes, using the washing machine, and taking a shower or bath are rescheduled to utilize the generated energy, which maximizes savings and minimizes emissions.",

	abstract = "The renewable energy sector has seen a rapid expansion in recent years and the number of green jobs is quickly increasing. The development of wind sector, associated with a strong focus on innovation, has given importance to the assessment of new and emerging hazards and risks for ensuring adequate, safe and healthy working conditions. The main aim of this paper is to provide a tool for improving proactive safety standards in onshore wind farms. The emergency management was outlined integrating some pinpointed indicators identified by wind turbines owners and manufacturers in a simple and practical instrument (risk assessment tool) aimed to facilitate emergency responses in case of accidents. The idea was to develop a systematic pattern that allows the employers and those responsible for the plant prevention to better manage an emergency event based on a risk assessment in an onshore wind farm during the operation stage. Specifically, the tool was tested and used to classify the risk level for occupational safety in 56 Italian onshore wind farms. The results obtained provide an overview of the crucial factors for optimizing the emergency management process in onshore wind farms at national level.",

  abstract       = {A feasibility study for the installation of Wave Energy Converters (WEC) in a Spanish Mediterranean port is evaluated in this paper. The final aim is to evaluate the possibility of building a new infrastructure which combines a breakwater and a WEC able to provide energy to the commercial port of Valencia. An estimation of the wave power potential is made according to existing databases from different sources. A review of the existing WEC types is carried out in order to choose the most suitable technology for its installation in a port environment. The authors discuss the main advantages and issues of the integration of WEC in port breakwaters. A prospective study for the Port of Valencia is made, considering the port energy demand evolution, historical data on wave energy potential and the port expansion plans. We conclude that Overtopping Devices (OTDs) are the most suitable ones to allow the good integration with the new breakwater needed for the expansion of the Port of Valencia and we give an estimation on the power available from the resource in our case study.},

  abstract       = {In the past three decades Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai have realised a meteoric economic rise. Whereas the former two can be considered \&lsquo;rentier states\&rsquo; heavily depending on oil (and gas) revenues, the latter only leans on oil for a mere 6\% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Although the economic rise has brought considerable welfare, it has also led these emirates to attain the world\&rsquo;s highest per capita carbon footprint. To address this problem Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai seem to have formulated policies with regard to sustainable urbanisation and adopted strong branding strategies to promote them internally and externally. In this paper we examine which steps have been taken to substantiate their claims to sustainable urbanisation, in branding as well as in actions taken towards implementation. We find that all three have been very active in branding their sustainable urbanisation policies, through visions and policy frameworks as well as prestigious development projects, but that the former is substantially more impressive than the latter. Results also show there is a difference between Abu Dhabi and Qatar on the one hand, and Dubai on the other. Dubai has large number of small \&lsquo;free economic zones\&rsquo;, academic institutions for developing a knowledge economy, and smart and/or sustainable urban neighbourhoods, while Qatar and Abu Dhabi have a small number of very large ones. From the three, it is currently Dubai which has taken the lead in this development, largely completing its industrial transition with vast economic diversification and urban expansion. However, across the board this has had little effect on its ecological footprint.},

  abstract = {The principal target of the present work is to assess the wave energy potential in the Black Sea, identifying also some relevant energetic features and possible patterns. A wave prediction system based on the Simulating Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) has been implemented and intensively tested in the entire sea basin. Moreover, considering an optimal interpolation technique, an assimilation scheme of the satellite data has been developed, leading to a visible improvement of the wave model predictions in terms of significant wave heights and, consequently, also in terms of wave power. Using this wave prediction system with data assimilation, simulations have been performed for a 15-year period (1999--2013). Considering the results of this 15-year wave hindcast, an analysis of the wave energy conditions in the basin of the Black Sea has been carried out. This provided a more comprehensive picture concerning the wave energy patterns in the coastal environment of the Black Sea focused on the average wave conditions that might be expected in this sea. Following the results presented, it can be concluded that the wave energy extraction in the Black Sea can become an issue of interest, especially from the perspective of the hybrid solutions.},

  abstract       = {Seasonal typhoons provide energy into the wave field in summer and autumn in Taiwan. Typhoons lead to abundant wave energy near the coastal area and cause storm surges that can destroy offshore facilities. The potential for wave energy can be obtained from analyzing the wave height. To develop an effective model for predicting typhoon-induced wave height near coastal areas, this study employed various popular data mining models---namely k-nearest neighbors (kNN), linear regressions (LR), model trees (M5), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms---as forecasting techniques. The principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed to reduce the potential variables from the original data at the first stage of data preprocessing. The experimental site was the Longdong buoy off the northeastern coast of Taiwan. Data on typhoons that occurred during 2002--2011 and 2012--2013 were collected for training and testing, respectively. This study designed four PCA cases, namely EV1, TV90, TV95, and ORI: EV1 used eigenvalues higher than 1.0 as principal components; TV90 and TV95 used the total variance percentages of 90\% and 95\%, respectively; and ORI used the original data. The forecast horizons varying from 1 h to 6 h were evaluated. The results show that (1) in the PCA model{\rq} cases, when the number of attributes decreases, computing time decreases and prediction error increases; (2) regarding classified wave heights, M5 provides excellent outcomes at the small wavelet wavelet level; MLP has favorable outcomes at the large wavelet and small/moderate wave levels; meanwhile, SVR gives optimal outcomes at the long wave and high/very high wave levels; and (3) for performance of lead times, MLP and SVR achieve more favorable relative weighted performance without consideration of computational complexity; however, MLP and SVR might obtain lower performance when computational complexity is considered.},
