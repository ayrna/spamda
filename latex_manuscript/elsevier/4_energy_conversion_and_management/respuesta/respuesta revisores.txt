A preliminary review of this paper has been conducted and we have the following comments:
Due to the large numbers of received submissions we are very selective in processing papers for publication. The processed papers are supposed to  meet the high scientific standards of the journal. The selected papers are supposed to provide significant  new contribution to the existing literature in the covered subject. Also, the submission is preferred to be in interdisciplinary energy subjects and to deal with novel and advanced energy systems or processes. Above that, the submission considers a too specific and not hot research topic in ECM. I am afraid I have to send your contribution back. Please do not consider it as a rejection but only a recommendation for a more appropriate Journal.  Please excuse us and understand our reasons. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.
