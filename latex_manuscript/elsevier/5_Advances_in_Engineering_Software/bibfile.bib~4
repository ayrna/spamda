	abstract = "This paper presents a shape-based approach to compute, in an optimal sense, the control of a single degree-of-freedom point absorber wave energy converter. In this study, it is assumed that a prediction for the wave is available. The control is computed so as to maximize the energy extraction over a future time horizon. In the shape-base approach, one of the system states is represented by a series expansion. The optimization variables are selected to be the coefficients in the series expansion instead of the history of the control variable. A gradient-based optimizer is used to optimize the series coefficients. The available wave prediction is used to compute an initial guess for the unknown series coefficients. This concept is tested on two different dynamic models: a simplified reduced-order model and a dynamic model with radiation dynamic states necessary to compute the radiation force. Several test cases are presented that cover a range of different sea states. The results show that the shape-based approach finds efficient solutions in terms of the extracted energy. The results also show that the obtained solutions are suitable for real-time implementation in terms of the smoothness of the obtained control and the speed of computations. Comparisons between the results of the shape-based approach and other techniques are presented and discussed.",

@article{Adams2010,
	abstract = "Satellite telemetry studies of the movements of seabirds are now common and have revealed impressive flight capabilities and extensive distributions among individuals and species at sea. Linking seabird movements with environmental conditions over vast expanses of the world's open ocean, however, remains difficult. Seabirds of the order Procellariiformes (e.g., petrels, albatrosses, and shearwaters) depend largely on wind and wave energy for efficient flight. We present a new method for quantifying the movements of far-ranging seabirds in relation to ocean winds measured by the SeaWinds scatterometer onboard the QuikSCAT satellite. We apply vector correlation (as defined by Crosby et al. in J Atm Ocean Tech 10:355--367, 1993) to evaluate how the trajectories (ground speed and direction) for five procellariiform seabirds outfitted with satellite transmitters are related to ocean winds. Individual seabirds (Sooty Shearwater, Pink-footed Shearwater, Hawaiian Petrel, Grey-faced Petrel, and Black-footed Albatross) all traveled predominantly with oblique, isotropic crossing to quartering tail-winds (i.e., 105--165{\textdegree} in relation to birds' trajectory). For all five seabirds, entire track line trajectories were significantly correlated with co-located winds. Greatest correlations along 8-day path segments were related to wind patterns during birds' directed, long-range migration (Sooty Shearwater) as well as movements associated with mega-scale meteorological phenomena, including Pacific Basin anticyclones (Hawaiian Petrel, Grey-faced Petrel) and eastward-propagating north Pacific cyclones (Black-footed Albatross). Wind strength and direction are important factors related to the overall movements that delineate the distribution of petrels at sea. We suggest that vector correlation can be used to quantify movements for any marine vertebrate when tracking and environmental data (winds or currents) are of sufficient quality and sample size. Vector correlation coefficients can then be used to assess population---or species-specific variability and used to test specific hypotheses related to how animal movements are associated with fluid environments.",

When considering a large number of buoys to reconstruct missing data, it is sometimes difficult to find a common period of completeness (without missing data on it) in the data to form a proper training and test set. In this paper we solve this issue by using partial reconstruction, which are then used as inputs of the EPUNN, with linear models. Missing data reconstruction in several phases or steps is then proposed. In this work we also show the potential of \{EPUNN\} to obtain simple, interpretable models in spite of the non-linear characteristic of the neural network, much simpler than the commonly used sigmoid-based neural systems. In the experimental section of the paper we show the performance of the proposed approach in a real case of massive missing data reconstruction in 6 wave-rider buoys at the Gulf of Alaska.",

The model highlights that assumptions about the {\lq}degree of competition{\rq} and about choices of lumping economic regions, and hence their heterogeneity, strongly affect model predictions about the rate of fossil fuel use and, consequently, the rate of climate change. In the model, decisionmakers (actors) make decisions about investment allocations into the goods producing economy and into carbon-based and non-carbon-based (renewable) energy supply, the remainder being for consumption. Actors are faced with the following dilemma situation. Economic growth requires energy and will therefore accelerate fossil fuel depletion and generate growth in carbon emissions, the latter leading to global warming and climate change induced damages. By developing non-carbon energy sources, which come initially at a higher cost than fossil fuels, growth of carbon emissions can be curtailed. Trying to optimize a consumption-related utility, actors base their decisions on the economically most rational investment portfolio for a finite time horizon. However, in their decisionmaking, they are constrained by the choices of other actors. We consider two prototypical situations: (i) a collaborative environment where all actors strive to maximize a world utility -- the global optimum -- and (ii) a situation where actors optimize the utility of their own country -- a solution that corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. The difference between both outcomes can be used to classify the severity of the {\lq}tragedy of the commons effect{\rq}. We present results about the dependence of the severity of this effect on several key parameters (i) the number of actors, (ii) the heterogeneity and severity of expected climate damages, (iii) assumptions about technology diffusion and (iv) fossil fuel depletion.",

First, BBNs subsume thousands of predictions to provide probabilistic outcomes. Second, by using prior probabilities, a practitioner can still obtain predictions of wave outcomes even when their knowledge of input parameters is incomplete. Third, BBNs can propagate evidence from outputs to inputs, which can be used to identify input conditions that are most likely to deliver a chosen outcome.

In this context, the assessment of wave energy potential along with socioeconomic and environmental factors in a selected area at the north side of Gran Canaria Island shows that wave power availability is adequate for its exploitation and there are no sources of potential conflicts that prevent the installation of wave energy converters.

Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the use of AI techniques and mixed models to estimate the volume and biomass of individual trees in vegetation of Brazilian central savanna. Numerical variables (diameter at height of 1.30 m of ground, total height, volume and biomass) and categorical variables (species) were used for the training and fitting of AI techniques and mixed models, respectively. The statistical indicators used to evaluate the training and the adjustment were the correlation coefficient, bias and Root mean square error relative. In addition, graphs were elaborated as complementary analysis. The results obtained by the statistical indicators and the graphical analysis show the great potential of AI techniques and mixed models in the estimation of volume and biomass of individual trees in Brazilian savanna vegetation.

Since fields are ageing, the amount of gas available for electric power production is declining. One common alternative is to feed those gas turbines with fuel diesel, which is an expensive solution at remote locations and has a high carbon footprint. Since oil and gas platforms often operate in deep waters and are exposed to energetic wave climates, ocean wave energy can be used in their electrification. Even though wave energy is not yet cost competitive for suppling onshore grids, power supplying remote oil and gas platforms might be the niche market enabler to launch commercially the sector, due to the high cost of the electricity produced in those offshore facilities and the abundance of wave resource at most of their locations. This paper proposes a new techno-economic model to assess and scale wave energy converters to match the local wave climate at their deployment site, while maximizing the income of the wave farm and accounting for their life cycle costs. At the same time, the economic feasibility of providing electricity from ocean waves to remote offshore oil and gas facilities is analysed using as case study an oil and gas platform in operation at the North Sea. Seven wave energy converters were assessed at the case study site and it was proved that its hydrodynamic performance is not directly linked to its economics attractiveness. The values of the levelized cost of energy ranged from 188 to 471 €/MWh and were benchmarked against reference values. The feasibility of providing electricity from waves to offshore oil and gas facilities is also demonstrated and the exploration of this untapped market advocated.",

	abstract = "Accurate solar photovoltaic power forecasting can help mitigate the potential risk caused by the uncertainty of photovoltaic out power in systems with high penetration levels of solar photovoltaic generation. Weather classification based photovoltaic power forecasting modeling is an effective method to enhance its forecasting precision because photovoltaic output power strongly depends on the specific weather statuses in a given time period. However, the most intractable problems in weather classification models are the insufficiency of training dataset (especially for the extreme weather types) and the selection of applied classifiers. Given the above considerations, a generative adversarial networks and convolutional neural networks-based weather classification model is proposed in this paper. First, 33 meteorological weather types are reclassified into 10 weather types by putting several single weather types together to constitute a new weather type. Then a data-driven generative model named generative adversarial networks is employed to augment the training dataset for each weather types. Finally, the convolutional neural networks-based weather classification model was trained by the augmented dataset that consists of both original and generated solar irradiance data. In the case study, we evaluated the quality of generative adversarial networks-generated data, compared the performance of convolutional neural networks classification models with traditional machine learning classification models such as support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors algorithm, investigated the precision improvement of different classification models achieved by generative adversarial networks, and applied the weather classification models in solar irradiance forecasting. The simulation results illustrate that generative adversarial networks can generate new samples with high quality that capture the intrinsic features of the original data, but not to simply memorize the training data. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks classification models show better classification performance than traditional machine learning models. And the performance of all these classification models is indeed improved to the different extent via the generative adversarial networks-based data augment. In addition, weather classification model plays a significant role in determining the most suitable and precise day-ahead photovoltaic power forecasting model with high efficiency.",

	abstract = "Food processing and conservation represent decisive factors for the sustainability of the planet given the significant growth of the world population in the last decades. Therefore, the cooling process during the manufacture and/or storage of food products has been subject of study and improvement in order to ensure the food supply with good quality and safety. A predictive tool for assessment of the energy performance in agrifood industries that use cold storage is developed in order to contribute to the improvement of the energy efficiency of this industry. The predictive tool is based on a set of characteristic correlated parameters: amount of raw material annually processed, annual energy consumption and volume of cold rooms. Case studies of application of the predictive tool consider industries in the meat sector, specifically slaughterhouses. The results obtained help on the decision-making of practice measures for improvement of the energy efficiency in this industry.",

	abstract = "The global development of the offshore renewable energy sector has been driven by extensive investment and research in the utilization of offshore renewable energies, mainly at the regional level. However, for mid to long-term marine energy development planning, a comprehensive assessment of the global potential for the exploitation of the main offshore resources is required. This work developed and implemented an innovative methodological approach to identify potential zones for wind and wave energy exploitation at the global level, using long-term data series with fine spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed methodology was based on a five-step approach comprised of: (i) a resource assessment, to identify the zones with favorable conditions for energy exploitation; (ii) a structural survivability assessment, to identify feasible areas which would likely ensure the integrity and durability of the wind and wave devices; (iii) a logistics assessment, to evaluate the possibility of carrying out installation, operations, and maintenance activities; (iv) an assessment of the distance to consumer centers, to estimate the feasibility of transmission to the main urban areas; and (v) an estimate of the extractable power of the identified potential zones. For wind power, the United Kingdom (with 1470 TWh/month using a 10-MW turbine) and the United States (1079 TWh/month) were the countries with the highest estimated energy output of the identified potential zones. For wave energy, Brazil and New Zealand presented good opportunities for the development of the wave energy industry, with an estimated extractable power of 372 TWh/month and 286 TWh/month, respectively. The unique preliminary global analysis presented in this work provides guidelines to assist in the development of wave and offshore wind industries, in addition to supporting the management of marine spaces. Moreover, the methodologies can be replicated for other marine activities.",

	abstract = "Measured wind speed and power output time series with 10-min resolution at Jhongtun wind power station and 30-min resolution at Mailiao station have been used to estimate monthly energy output by artificial neural networks (ANNs) over a period spanned between 2002 and 2006. The widely used back propagation algorithm is used in the network. The available database of these two stations is divided into two parts -- data from Year 2002 to Year 2005 is for training and Year 2006 data is used for the validation of training results. For the purpose of investigating the adequate training length of ANN simulations, four training periods (Year 2002--2005, 2003--2005, 2004--2005 and 2005) together with four training intervals (yearly, half-yearly, seasonal, and monthly) are input into the ANN model to estimate monthly capacity factors of the two stations at Year 2006 and compared with the measured data. The results show that ANN is an efficient tool for estimating wind power production. A training length with 12months can provide satisfactory estimation of monthly capacity factors in both of the stations. Moreover, the half-yearly training interval, which is derived from the real wind characteristics in Taiwan, gives the best estimation of monthly capacity factors compared to other training intervals.",

	abstract = "As renewable energy becomes increasingly popular in the global electric energy grid, improving the accuracy of renewable energy forecasting is critical to power system planning, management, and operations. However, this is a challenging task due to the intermittent and chaotic nature of renewable energy data. To date, various methods have been developed, including physical models, statistical methods, artificial intelligence techniques, and their hybrids to improve the forecasting accuracy of renewable energy. Among them, deep learning, as a promising type of machine learning capable for discovering the inherent nonlinear features and high-level invariant structures in data, has been frequently reported in the literature. This paper provides a comprehensive and extensive review of renewable energy forecasting methods based on deep learning to explore its effectiveness, efficiency and application potential. We divide the existing deterministic and probabilistic forecasting methods based on deep learning into four groups, namely deep belief network, stack auto-encoder, deep recurrent neural network and others. We also dissect the feasible data preprocessing techniques and error post-correction methods to improve the forecasting accuracy. Extensive analysis and discussion of various deep learning based forecasting methods are given. Finally, we explore the current research activities, challenges and potential future research directions in this topic.",
