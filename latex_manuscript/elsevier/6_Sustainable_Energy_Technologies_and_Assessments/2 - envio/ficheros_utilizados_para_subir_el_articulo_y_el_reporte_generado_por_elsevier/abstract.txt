Meteorological data are extensively used to perform environmental learning. Machine Learning (ML) techniques, a valuable support in many research areas, require datasets containing information related to the topic under study, which are not always available in an appropriate format, and its preparation and pre-processing implies a lot of time and effort by the researchers. This paper presents a novel software tool with an user-friendly GUI to create datasets by means of management and data integration of meteorological observations from two well-known sources of information: the National Data Buoy Center and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis Project. Such datasets can be created using buoys and reanalysis data by customisable procedures, in terms of predictive and objective variables and temporal resolution. These datasets can be used by ML methodologies for prediction tasks (classification or regression) that support improvement of sustainability energy production, design of production systems as WECs or environmental modelling, among others.
