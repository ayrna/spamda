First of all, we would like to thank the editor for the suggestions given to improve the paper. According to them, we have included these issues in the cover letter, and we have also taken the opportunity to write some of these clarifications in the paper. Concretely, the Introduction (last paragraphs before the beginning of Section 2), the Conclusions and the Abstract have been modified.
