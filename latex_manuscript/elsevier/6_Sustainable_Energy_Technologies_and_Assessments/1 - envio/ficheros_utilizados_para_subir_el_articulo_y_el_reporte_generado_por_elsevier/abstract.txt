Meteorological data play an important role for the comprehension of the environment, and they are extensively used to perform environmental learning. Machine Learning (ML) techniques, a valuable support in many research areas, require datasets containing information related to the topic under study, which are not always available in an appropriate format, and its preparation implies a lot of time and effort by the researchers. This paper presents a software for creating datasets using meteorological observations from two well-known sources of information: the National Data Buoy Center and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis Project. As the designed software is able to simplify the creation of the datasets (ready to be used as inputs for ML techniques in prediction tasks) and reduce the time needed for this task, researchers can benefit from it in order to achieve a more efficient exploitation and protection of environmental resources.
